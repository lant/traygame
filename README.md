# Traygame 
**Disclaimer: This has been developed in order to have a practical example to learn golang** 

This is a very simple implementation of the [Tray game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim%27s_Game), also known as *Kim's game* . Basically an observation and memory game. 

This implementation uses the *dict* file in order to collect random words and show them to the player for a given amount of time. 

After that time, the list is shown again with the same list missing some words and in a different order. The player needs to write the missing words.
